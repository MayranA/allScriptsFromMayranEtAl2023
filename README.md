# tempAllScriptsFromMayranEtAl2023

All scripts to reproduce figures in Mayran et al. 2023 from raw data.

There is one directory per type of analysis ([ATACseq](./ATACseq), [RNAseq](./RNAseq), [scRNAseq](./scRNAseq), [dissociation statistics](./dissociation), [IF analysis on membrane](./membrane.IF.analysis), [phenotype SnaiKO statistics](./phenotype_Snai1KO)). Each directory contains a README file and is independent.

The analyses involving both RNAseq and scRNAseq were put in the [combine_scRNAseq_RNAseq](./combine_scRNAseq_RNAseq) directory.

All outputs were centralized into the [output.files](./output.files) directory.

All panels present in the paper are symlinked in the [figures](./figures) directory.
