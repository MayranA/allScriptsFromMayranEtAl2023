# Combine scRNA-seq and RNA-seq

## Gene expression correlation among single gastruloids

In order to generate the heatmap of correlations of gene markers of 48-72h among single gastruloids. [This quarto](./correlation_single_gastru.qmd) has been used.

## Time-course bulk RNA-seq sample correlation on top markers

In order to generate the heatmap of correlations of samples using single-cell markers. [This quarto](./time-course_48-72h_markers.qmd) has been used.

## Snai1 mis-regulated genes on Single Cell RNAseq WT

For the analysis of single cell behavior of gene mis-regulated in Snai mutant gastruloids. [This quarto](./snai1_genes_on_sc.qmd) has been used.
